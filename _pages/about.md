Hi! I'm Maciek (formal spelling Maciej), a data scientist at Fintern in London.

<b>Research</b>: My research interests lie in the areas of <b>automated music transformations</b> and <b>generative models</b> for audio synthesis, with an emphasis on introducing control over rhythmic manipulation of percussion recordings. For more information about my background and research, please take a look at my [CV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10lnx5UwlpoNpXmMbkFBb5yGPgHof5FKq) and [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2upPg60AAAAJ).

<b>Previously</b>: I graduated with a <b>PhD in Generative Modelling for Audio Synthesis</b> from the Birmingham City University (BCU) where I was advised by Dr [Jason Hockman](https://www.schoolofdigitalarts.mmu.ac.uk/staff/jason-hockman/). Prior to that I received my BSc degree in Sound Engineering and Production from BCU. Past antics [this way](/maciek.github.io).

<b>Music and Dubbing</b>: I also enjoy creating various sound and music projects. Since 2009, I've been part of NanoKarrin, the largest Polish <b>fandubbing group</b> that brings together amateurs, professionals and everyone in between. My roles include sound engineering (<b>mixing & mastering</b> of music projects) and recruitment. For more details, please see [this page](/dubbing).
